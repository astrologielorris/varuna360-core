        Kala's Cards of Truth screen draws three cards per cell: a small one at
        the bottom left, the card face in the middle, and a small one at the top
        right. They are not three calculations. The birth spread occupies
        fourteen consecutive seats of the queen quadration, and the two small
        cards are simply what the OTHER two quadrations hold at those same
        seats. The screen is headed "Queen Quadration" because that names which
        of the three the faces come from.

        Returns ``(jack_row, queen_row, king_row)``, each a list of fourteen
        two-letter card CODES. ``queen_row`` is exactly
        ``get_birthspread_from_quadration(birthcard)`` translated through
        ``cards_constants.cards``.

        Codes rather than deck indices so that a caller never has to index
        ``cards_constants.cards`` itself — that is app-side arithmetic on an
        engine table, and it is the step where an off-by-one turns into a wrong
        card that still looks like a card.

        The seat comes from the QUEEN quadration for all three rows. Do not
        "simplify" this to::

            CoT.get_birthspread_from_quadration(birthcard, CoT.king_quadration())

        That re-finds the birth card in the king deck, where it sits at a
        different seat, and returns a different fourteen cards. For birth card
        3D the seat is 5 in the queen deck but 16 in the king deck::

            this method : QD 2C AS 9H 4D JH 6D 6S AC 9S 7S 3D 6H AD
            that call   : 3D 6H AD TC 8C 3S 4H 5S QS 6C 3H AH 9D 5C

        It never raises, and the wrong answer is not noise: ``quadraten(jackquad,
        2)`` IS the king quadration, so that call returns the year spread for
        age 1 -- a real spread from a different screen.

        The same substitution is available on the jack row and is HARMLESS only
        because the jack quadration is the unshuffled deck, so its own seat
        always coincides. Do not conclude from that that the seats are
        interchangeable.

        Three birth cards hide the error completely: JH, 8C and KS are the fixed
        points where the card sits at the same seat in the queen and king decks.
        A chart with one of those as its birth card cannot detect the wrong
        call, and its Mars/Jupiter/Uranus cell shows the same card three times.
